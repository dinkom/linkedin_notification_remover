# LinkedIn Notification Remover

https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/linkedin-notification-rem/ebdaifcninhnhdecfkpapkccbhiahjgi

This extension will remove the 'We found new people in your network' notification from LinkedIn

The extension runs quietly in the background of your browser and removes the red number (notification for "We found new people in your network") on the top left navigation on LinkedIn. If you find that notification to be annoying, then this extension is for you. Install/enable it and that's it, no further action needed.
